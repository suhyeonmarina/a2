     conda create -n cse402 python=3.12


# 2. Activate you environment:

    conda activate cse402


# 3. Install Jupyter notebook

    pip install notebook


# 4. Install pytorch, torchvision, torchaudio

     pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio

     - This example uses Linux, pip, and CUDA 12.4. Please choose the installation option that matches your operating system and local settings.

# 5. Install additional packages (depending on your devices)

## No `zip` command for Windows
If you are using Windows, you may see an error when running the `collect_submission.sh` script. This is because the `zip` command is not available by default on Windows. 
If you encounter this error, you can try other methods mentioned [here](https://superuser.com/questions/201371/create-zip-folder-from-the-command-line-windows). Alternatively, you can manually zip the Python files.
